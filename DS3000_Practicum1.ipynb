    "The data science problem we were given concerns airline performance from 1987 to present, as provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The dataset contains airlines and their correlated figures, including arrival and departure data, flight distances, delays, among others. We specifically focused on the subset of this data containing statistics from flights which departed from CA, AZ, and NV in 2019. Given this data, we were tasked with analyzing the air traffic at certain airports/regions and analyzing the air traffic at certain airports/regions, by processing and visualizing data to find key takeaways regarding patterns, performance, and summary statistics."

Examining the standard devation of delays across carriers shows that the carrier with the greatest variation in arrival and departure delays is YX of almost 70 minutes.  The carrier with the least variability in terms of delays is EV with just under 20 minutes.  Therefore, VW flights tend to have lower delays and have more consistent delay patterns.  In contrast, YX flights tend to have greater delays and less consistent delay patterns.  Generally across airline carriers, the variability of delay patterns are similar for arrival and departure delays.

    "Based on the summary statistics, the average flight date was 7/3/2019, indicating that the flight data has a relatively even spread since July is close to the middle of the year.  The most common carrier code was WN, which based on the previous data on delays, seems to have some of the lowest arrival and departure delays compared to other carriers.  Therefore, WN seems to be the least prone to delays.  The mode origin and destination were both CA, indicating that there is likely high air traffic in this region due to the number of incoming as well as outgoing flights.  Both arrival and departure times tend to have a similar average delay, which was also reflected in the previous charts.  The average distance is 1146.86 and this can vary by about 756.42 based on the standard deviation.  This can be reviewed on a region basis since longer average distances might indicate the presense of more international flights at an airport.  Lower average distances might indicate a more regional airport with high or low traffic based on other measures like the number of arriving or departing flights. The average elapsed time is 174.81 and the standard deviation of this time is 92.73.  Similar to the distances, this can be reviewed on a region basis to further determine air traffic at specific locations."

    "#  **Question 7 – Overall Analysis Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the 2019 On-Time Performance dataset for flights originating from Arizona (AZ), Nevada (NV), and California (CA), we have identified several key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Key Finding 1: California Has the Most Air Traffic (Question 3)**  \n",
    "Our analysis revealed that **California (CA)** had the highest air traffic among AZ, NV, and CA, determined by the frequency of flights. This reflects both the state's population size and its role as a major hub for domestic travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Key Finding 2: American Airlines Operates Most Selected Aircraft with Moderate to High Delays (Questions 4 & 6)**  \n",
    "In our carrier analysis (Question 4), **American Airlines (AA)** emerged as a key operator, with varying levels of delays. The detailed aircraft analysis (Question 6) of three specific aircraft (**N972NN, N352PS, N305NX**) showed:  \n",
    "- High average delays (up to **17.61 mins**) and variable maximum delays (up to 556 mins).  \n",
    "- Delays were notably higher on busy routes such as **DFW-SNA** and **SNA-ORD**, pointing to congestion and operational challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Key Finding 3: Distance and Delays Show a Weak Correlation (Question 6)**  \n",
    "The **distance** field in the dataset represents the miles flown per flight segment (between ORIGIN and DEST). For each aircraft, the average distance traveled per flight was approximately **1,426 to 1,487 miles**.  \n",
    "- Even with similar average distances, delays varied significantly across flights.  \n",
    "- This highlights that factors such as airport congestion, weather, and operational issues likely have a larger impact on delays than the distance flown.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Clarification on Distance Calculation**  \n",
    "Each row in the dataset corresponds to an individual flight, and the **distance** field represents the distance covered on that specific flight. The average distance we calculated per aircraft reflects the **mean distance of all its flights**, not the total distance flown by the aircraft.  \n",
    "- To extend the analysis, we could calculate the **total distance covered by each aircraft** by summing the distance values for all its flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Visualizations and Analysis**  \n",
    "Throughout the practicum, we created visualizations with clear titles and labeled axes:  \n",
    "- **Bar plots** for average delays and distances by aircraft (Questions 4 & 6)  \n",
    "- **Boxplots** showing delay variability by aircraft (Question 6)  \n",
    "- **Proportional analysis** of airlines in each region (Question 3)\n",
